## About
Uses GPT-J with some training prompts to generate professional translations of sentences.

Just an idea that was made for fun.

## Built With
**Python**, using GPT-J model via a [free public api](https://github.com/vicgalle/gpt-j-api).

Hosted via [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You can use Streamlit if you would like to make your own version, with a less restrictive limit on requests or a different model.

### Installation
Training prompts are included in training_text.py.

Different settings or API can be set in streamlit_app.py. Streamlit cloud can be used for free hosting.
## Usage
Go to the [demo page](https://share.streamlit.io/clukes/professionalai) and enter a prompt. May need to generate multiple times for a better result. However, there is a limit on requests to the API.

Example:

> Enter prompt: I can't work if you keep bothering me.

> Generated result: My work is a priority and you're taking it away from me. 


Unfortunately, the requests are very limited (20 requests in 30 mins), since I am using a free API for GPT-J.
